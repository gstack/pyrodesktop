Pyro creates a Web-based desktop by drawing your entire screen as a Web Page. Using the trusted Mozilla Add-On system, all the capabilities of dynamic HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are exposed to enable incredible extensions and themes. Using the newest generation of Linux display technology, called window compositing, Pyro deftly handles native applications as a regular part of the Web Desktop.
